# 1. Nullable

By default, all types in PostgreSQL are nullable. Therefore, our
default handling is to map parameters to the nullable type (`T?`)
in .NET, which is similar to the `Maybe` type in Haskell.

If a PostgreSQL function has been defined as `STRICT` or `RETURN
NULL ON NULL INPUT`, it will not be executed if any of its arguments
are null. In these situations, we represent the type as the
non-nullable `T` type in .NET. If you want to use nullable types
for these types, you can set the `AlwaysNullable` variable to true
in the `dotnet_src/Engine.cs file`.

Please note that after making changes to the `dotnet_src/Engine.cs
file`, you will need to rebuild the Debian packages and reinstall
*pldotnet*.

The following sections contain examples of how the generated C# and
F# function should look for nullable and non-nullable types.

## 1.1 C#

The PostgreSQL function below was previously defined in the Basic
usage page, which explains how to create functions using *pldotnet*
in the database.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION are_integers_equal(a integer, b integer) RETURNS boolean AS $$
return a == b;
$$ LANGUAGE plcsharp;
```

The C# functions below illustrate the generated code for nullable
and non-nullable types, respectively.

```csharp
public static bool? are_integers_equal(int? a, int? b)
{
    return a == b;
}
```

```csharp
public static bool? are_integers_equal(int a, int b)
{
    return a == b;
}
```
zsh:1: command not found: fm
```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION are_integers_equal(a integer, b integer) RETURNS boolean AS $$
a.Equals(b)
$$ LANGUAGE plfsharp;
```

The following F# code examples demonstrate the generated code for
nullable and non-nullable types, respectively.

```fsharp
static member are_integers_equal (a: Nullable<int>) (b: Nullable<int>) : Nullable<bool> =
    a.Equals(b)
```

```fsharp
static member are_integers_equal (a: int) (b: int) : Nullable<bool> =
    a.Equals(b)
```

It is important to note that the `Nullable<T>` type is only used
for F# structures, not classes. As a result, there is no change for
class objects when using the nullable type on F#.

# 2. Array

All supported data types also support arrays of that type, whether
they are single-dimensional or multi-dimensional. Currently, this
is achieved using the Npgsql convention of mapping them to
[`Array<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array?view=net-7.0),
but this type mapping is cumbersome compared to the slightly different
[`T[]`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/)
representation.

The following are two PostgreSQL functions written using *plcsharp*
and *plfsharp*, respectively, that modify an one-dimensional array
of integers. The function takes in an array of integers and a integer
as input, and returns the modified array.


```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION modify_1d_array(a integer[], b int) RETURNS integer[] AS $$
a.SetValue(b, 0);
return a;
$$ LANGUAGE plcsharp;
```

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION modify_1d_array(a integer[], b int) RETURNS integer[] AS $$
a.SetValue(b.Value, 0);
a
$$ LANGUAGE plfsharp;
```

Here is the generated code for both the C# and F# versions of the
function:

```csharp
public static Array? modify_1d_array(Array? a, int? b)
{
    a.SetValue(b, 0);
    return a;
}
```

```fsharp
static member modify_1d_array (a: Array) (b: Nullable<int>) : Array =
    a.SetValue(b.Value, 0);
    a
```

When using the `Array` class, we do not need to worry about using
multidimensional arrays, as demonstrated in the following code.
However, this method has lower performance than using `T[]`.
Therefore, we plan to use `T[]` for array mapping in the future,
which will require the user to specify the dimensions of the array
when creating the function.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION modify_array(a integer[], b int) RETURNS integer[] AS $$
let dim = a.Rank
match dim with
| 1 ->
    a.SetValue(b, 0) |> ignore
    a
| 2 ->
    a.SetValue(b, 0, 0) |> ignore
    a
| 3 ->
    a.SetValue(b, 0, 0, 0) |> ignore
    a
| _ ->
    Elog.Info("Returning the input array...") |> ignore
    a
$$ LANGUAGE plfsharp;
```

Now, with the following command:

```sql
select modify_array(array[1,2,3,4,5], 10);
```

We got the following output:

```bash
  modify_array
 --------------
  {10,2,3,4,5}
```

A second example:

```sql
select modify_array(array[[1,2,null],[3,4,5]], 10);
```

The output:

```bash
      modify_array
 -----------------------
  {{10,2,NULL},{3,4,5}}
```
