# PL/.NET

Welcome to PL/.NET (a.k.a. pldotnet), a free add-on module for PostgreSQL
that adds the ability to use Microsoft's .NET framework as a loadable
procedural language. With pldotnet, you can write stored procedures
and triggers in C# or F#, directly within PostgreSQL. This allows you
to take advantage of the power and versatility of the .NET platform to
develop custom logic that is closely integrated with your database.

Pldotnet was developed by [Brick Abode](http://www.brickabode.com) and
officially released in January 2023. It has proven to be an efficient
and effective tool for extending PostgreSQL with the power of .NET and
its application development environment.

To get started with pldotnet, you will need to install it on your
PostgreSQL server. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the
pldotnet [Wiki pages](https://github.com/Brick-Abode/pldotnet/wiki), along
with examples and information on the supported PostgreSQL data types.

We hope you enjoy using pldotnet to bring the power of .NET to your
PostgreSQL database. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate
to reach out to the Brick Abode team or open an issue or a discussion
topic on our GitHub repository.
